# Blackjack Client

A simplistic blackjack client, made with angularjs and some other things.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

NodeJS, npm and git are required.

### Install Dependencies

Project is preconfigured to automatically install required dependencies, simply:

```
npm install
```

You can install `bower`, `jade` and `node-sass` globally if you so desire.

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`, which sets up AngularJS dependencies.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

### Build the local files

Local `sass` and `jade` files need to be compiled to `css` and `html`, do so by running: 

``` 
npm run build
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
